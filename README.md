# TAbot

## Description

This project was conducted from 22.10.12. to 22.11.12. as a Drones and Robotics course in the 2nd semester of the 3rd year of Gachon University.

We wanted to assist the class through this project, and for this, we implemented three functions using an agile method.

## Tutorial

Each of the three functions is performed through a user's gesture.

Through a `fist gesture`, the drone **identifies whether the classmates attend** the class and **shows a list** of the classmates who attended.

The `scissors gesture` will **record the professor's class**

If you want to **stop recording**, you can `add your thumb to the scissor gesture`

**Take a panoramic photo** of the classroom through the `paper gesture` and leave a photo of students' attendance.
